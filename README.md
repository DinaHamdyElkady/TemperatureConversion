#  Temperature Conversion in C Language

This is a simple temperature conversion program implemented in C language. It allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit scales.

## Overview

In this endeavor, I developed a robust program capable of accurately converting temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.

## Features

- Implemented conversion formulas for precise temperature transformation between Celsius and Fahrenheit scales.
- Leveraged mathematical operations to handle conversions seamlessly, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.
- Developed error handling mechanisms to enhance the reliability of the program.
- Rigorously tested the codebase to validate its functionality and performance.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `celsius_to_fahrenheit.c` file using a C compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable file.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input temperatures in Celsius and observe the converted values in Fahrenheit.

## Example Usage

```bash
gcc celsius_to_fahrenheit.c -o celsius_to_fahrenheit
./celsius_to_fahrenheit
